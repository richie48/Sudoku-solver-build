# Sudoku-solver-build
I loved to play sudoku a whole lot when i was like 10, then there used to be a new sudoku board to solve in newspapers every-week. I decided to reconnect with my childhood by trying to solve a sudoku board, but this time with code. 10 years old me should maybe have tried backtrackingðŸ˜‚

-I attempted to explain some parts of my code with comments. Also to test out the algorithm with other sudoku boards all you have to do is modify the board passed into the object of the class Sudoku.
