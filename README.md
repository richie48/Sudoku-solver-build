# Sudoku-solver-build
I loved to play sudoku a whole lot when i was like 10, then there used to be a new sudoku board to solve in newspapers every-week. I decided to reconnect with my childhood by trying to solve a sudoku board, but this time with code. 10 years old me should maybe have tried backtracking
-I attempted to explain some parts of my code with comments.
